# GraphFS

Imagine you drop all your files into a single "bucket," and this file store understands:

- How to best store all your files
- The content of the files
- Finds similar and related files
- Establishes data lineage

And much, much more. GraphFS leverages the power of graph and vector databases to accomplish just that.
